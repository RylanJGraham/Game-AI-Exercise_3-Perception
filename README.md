# GameAI Exercise 03: Perception
## About
The following repository was created to host class exercise 03 from Game AI lesson in CITM UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to implement an AI algorithm in which some Zombies will start chasing the Player (agent) depending on their camera frustum perception. To do so, we used Unity game engine in its **2021.3.14f1 version** and some free assets from the Unity Assets Store and then we implemented the algorithm using C# Unity scripts.
